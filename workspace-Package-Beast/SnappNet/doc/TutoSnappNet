*********** How to install SnappNet ****************************************************************************** 

-First, you have to install Beast 2 from https://www.beast2.org/

-Next, you have to install the package by hand (since SnappNet paper is only submitted)

  -see the section "install by hand" at https://www.beast2.org/managing-packages/
  -let us follow the steps described on this official webpage

    -Get the file SnappNet.addon.zip  located in the folder MySnappNet/workspace-Package-Beast/SnappNet/build/dist
    -Create a SnappNet subdirectory

    	    for Windows in Users\<YourName>\BEAST\2.X\SnappNet
	    for Mac in /Users/<YourName>\/Library/Application Support/BEAST/2.X/SnappNet
	    for Linux /home/<YourName>/.beast/2.X/SnappNet

	    “2.X” the X refers to the major version of BEAST, for instance version 2.6
     

     -Next, unzip the file  SnappNet.addon.zip inside the  SnappNet directory
     -Get the file version.xml located in MySnappNet/workspace-Package-Beast/SnappNet/release/package
     -Copy version.xml in the SnappNet directory

   -run Beauti (from the folder where Beast is installed) with the command line   ./bin/beauti 

   File ---> Clear Class Paths
   File ---> Exit

   -run Beauti again  ./bin/beauti

   File ----> Template 
   You should now see SnappNetTemplate
